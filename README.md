# SuboptimalCodeForMundaneTasks
Suboptimal Code For Mundane Tasks, is a repo that will focus on all the boring repetitive aspects of coding. 

The goal is to have it updated and stored here to be redeployed across many organisations. 

Initially will be only doing PowerShell Scripts as I am managing a windows only environment. 





To Do List: 

.Net Auto Updater / Remover 
Script that can be finetuned easily for organisations for software installations (Mini winget but for Orgs & Doesn't Actually Use Winget)
